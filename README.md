So here's the thing, in a few months you're going on a trip, and you got flight tickets to pay or whatever.
You take a paper and then you start counting how much you got, the taxes, the food etc.
It's over.
This programm is very simple, few lines of code and gives how much money you have to save (if you can) every month to pay your trip !  
Just clone the repository and run :

```ruby main.rb```
